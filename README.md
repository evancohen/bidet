# 🚽 bidet 💦
> DIY IoT Bidet - Because why doesn't this already exist?

In mid-March (when 🧻 was nowhere to be found) I joked with friends that "it's time to invest in bidet stocks!" Fast forward a month later and TP is still in short supply. With all of this free time self-isolating, I began thinking: "why not build my own bidet?" And thus, another horrible internet of things project was born...

## Butt what should it be able to do?
- [ ] **📱 Integrated Mobile App** - a locally hosted PWA to provide users with a streamlined butt washing UX (it doesn't exist if it doesn't have an app)
  - [ ] **🎛 Pressure control** - everyone has their prefrence, precision pressure control is important
  - [ ] **💗 Pulseation** - varying water pressure because that sounds nice
  - [ ] **🌊 Oscillation** - widen the cleaning area
  - [ ] **🔥 Heat control** - not sure I want to deal with heat coils, but it's on the list!
  - [ ] **📈 Usage metrics** - log your toilet time and monitor water usage
- [ ] **🚻 ButtID™** - uniquely identify the user (by weight?) and load their presets
- [ ] **💬 Voice interaction** - don't be touching things
- [ ] **🚽 Auto-Flush** - Flush the toilet automaticlly after use
  - [ ] **🔰 Yellow-mellow mode** - thinking yellow to be green
- [ ] **🚽 Auto-Open/Close** - Open on approach. Also maybe it could open and close the lid like a mouth and talk to you like a friend oh god i'm so lonely. Also maybe do foot direction detection to lift the lid and seat?
- [ ] **🎶 Auto play music** - nobody wants to hear you in the bathroom. What better time to get turnt?
- [ ] **💦 Auto moisten** - when you sit down it wets the sides so 💩 don't stick
- [ ] **🧙‍♂️ X/Y/(Z?)** - precision wand placement for 100% accuracy (not trying to soak those cheeks)
- [ ] **🥒 Vegan** - that's right, it's totally vegan!

... more soon!

## Things to research  
I've never built a bidet before. The closest thing that I have experience with, at least conceptually, is an emergency add-on to my sump pump that I built when it broke (story for antother time). Basiclly I have no idea what I'm doing or where to start, but that's what makes for the best projects!

### Approach
Always do the hardest thing first! I could build out the entire mobile app and a lot of the circuitry first, but those are the things I already know how to do... I'm going to tackle the plumbing first. Starting with, how does a bidet work?

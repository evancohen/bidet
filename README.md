# 🚽 bidet 💦
> DIY IoT Bidet - Because why doesn't this already exist?

In mid-March (when 🧻 was nowhere to be found) I joked with friends that "it's time to invest in bidet stocks!" Fast forward a month later and TP is still in short supply. With all of this free time self-isolating, I began thinking: "why not build my own bidet?" And thus, another horrible internet of things project was born...

## Butt what should it be able to do?
- [ ] **📱 Integrated Mobile App** - a locally hosted PWA to provide users with a streamlined butt washing UX (it doesn't exist if it doesn't have an app)
  - [ ] **🎛 Pressure control** - everyone has their prefrence, precision pressure control is important
  - [ ] **🔥 Heat control** - not sure I want to deal with heat coils, but it's on the list!
  - [ ] **📈 Usage metrics** - log your toilet time and monitor water usage
- [ ] **🚻 ButtID™** - uniquely identify the user (by weight?) and load their presets
- [ ] **💬 Voice interaction** - don't be touching things
- [ ] **🚽 Auto-Flush** - Flush the toilet automaticlly after use
- [ ] **🎶Auto play music** - nobody wants to hear you in the bathroom. What better time to get turnt?
- [ ] **💦 Auto moisten** - when you sit down it wets the sides so 💩 don't stick
- [ ] **🧙‍♂️ X/Y/(Z?)** - precision wand placement for 100% accuracy (not trying to soak those cheeks)

... more soon!

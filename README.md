# ðŸš½ bidet ðŸ’¦
> DIY IoT Bidet - Because why doesn't this already exist?

In mid-March (when ðŸ§» was nowhere to be found) I joked with friends that, "now is the time to invest in bidet stocks!" Fast forward a month later and TP is still in short supply. With all of this extra free time self-isolating, I began thinking: "why not build my own bidet?" And thus, another horrible internet of things project was born...

## Butt what should it be able to do?
- [ ] **Integrated Mobile App** - a locally hosted PWA to provide users with a streamlined butt washing UX (it doesn't exist if it doesn't have an app)
  - [ ] **Pressure control** - everyone has their prefrence, precision pressure control is important
  - [ ] **Heat control** - not sure I want to deal with heat coils, but it's on the list!
  - [ ] **Usage metrics** - log your toilet time and monitor water usage
- [ ] **ButtIDâ„¢** - uniquely identify the user (by weight?) and load their presets
- [ ] **Voice interaction** - don't be touching things
- [ ] **Auto-Flush** - Flush the toilet automaticlly after use
- [ ] **Auto play music** - (custom playlist per user?)
- [ ] **Auto moisten** - when you sit down it wets the sides so ðŸ’© don't stick
